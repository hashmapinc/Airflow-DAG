[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fhashmapinc%2FAirflow-DAG.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fhashmapinc%2FAirflow-DAG?ref=badge_shield)


The code here accompanies the blog article [Orchestration and DAG Design in Apache Airflow - Two Approaches](https://medium.com/hashmapinc/orchestration-and-dag-design-in-apache-airflow-two-approaches-35edd3eaf7c0). 

In order to execute the code you will need to have airflow installed and running. This project also uses
pipenv as its python package manager. Under the current assumptions, your DAGs will be copied into the airflow/dags directory.
